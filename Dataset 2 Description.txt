We're trying to predict the ordinal variable damage_grade, which represents a level of damage to the building that was hit by the earthquake. There are 3 grades of the damage:

1 represents low damage
2 represents a medium amount of damage
3 represents almost complete destruction

The dataset mainly consists of information on the buildings' structure and their legal ownership. Each row in the dataset represents a specific building in the region that was hit by Gorkha earthquake.

There are 39 columns in this dataset, where the building_id column is a unique and random identifier. The remaining 38 features are described in the section below. Categorical variables have been obfuscated random lowercase ascii characters. The appearance of the same character in distinct columns does not imply the same original value.

geo_level_1_id, geo_level_2_id, geo_level_3_id (type: int): geographic region in which building exists, from largest (level 1) to most specific sub-region (level 3). Possible values: level 1: 0-30, level 2: 0-1427, level 3: 0-12567.

1. count_floors_pre_eq (type: int): number of floors in the building before the earthquake.

2. age (type: int): age of the building in years.

3. area_percentage (type: int): normalized area of the building footprint.

4. height_percentage (type: int): normalized height of the building footprint.

5. land_surface_condition (type: categorical): surface condition of the land where the building was built. Possible values: n, o, t.

6. foundation_type (type: categorical): type of foundation used while building. Possible values: h, i, r, u, w.

7. roof_type (type: categorical): type of roof used while building. Possible values: n, q, x.

8. ground_floor_type (type: categorical): type of the ground floor. Possible values: f, m, v, x, z.

9. other_floor_type (type: categorical): type of constructions used in higher than the ground floors (except of roof). Possible values: j, q, s, x.

10. position (type: categorical): position of the building. Possible values: j, o, s, t.

11. plan_configuration (type: categorical): building plan configuration. Possible values: a, c, d, f, m, n, o, q, s, u.
